# Alessandro Dos Santos

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alessandro, a machine learning researcher with an affinity for computer vision applications, algorithms, and plain old problem solving. I enjoy learning, sports, video games, socializing, the outdoors, and movies in my free time! I like to think that I'm a Master of None working to become a Master of Some, especially in the algorithmic domain. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's Degree in Computer Science, both from the University of North Dakota. You can check out my thesis [here](#1)!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
1. A comprehensive supervised project that conditions a real-time semantic segmentation CNN with the semantic boundary detection (SBD) task. I have plans to submit a paper on this project to an IEEE conference.
2. An unsupervised project that leverages hierarchical clustering and deep learning CNN and ViT models to group objects at varying granularities.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
(or relearning) more about set theory and proofs, probability and statistics, and all things algorithms. I'm also learning more about quantitative trading in my free time!
